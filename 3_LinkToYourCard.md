# Link to your Card
If you are here you must have completed the exercise. You can push your Tic Tc Toe branch up and submit a pull request.

Check out the main branch, update your local repository, and create a NEW branch (branch name will be yourinitialsCardLink: Jane Doe's = **jdCardLink**) . Now you will be working on creating a link to your page. Do not use the same branch you used for the Tic Tac Toe exercise. This is a new feature. 

On the home.html page modify Contact button on your card to be a link to your html page:

```js
 <p><button class="button">Contact</button></p>
```
Try to figure this one out. The button should read "My Project" and be a simple link to your newly created html page.

Once you are done make sure to push your branch up and submit a pull request. 

After all branches have been merged to the main branch, make sure to update your main branch.
